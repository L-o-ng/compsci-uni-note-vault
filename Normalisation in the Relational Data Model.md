Normalisation allows a database designer to identify a set of relations wit desirable properties for the given use case. So, there are:
+ A minimal number of attributes.
+ Attributes have a close, logical relationship.
+ Minimal redundancy.

This is an example of a *bottom-up* technique, but allows *validation* of top-down design.
