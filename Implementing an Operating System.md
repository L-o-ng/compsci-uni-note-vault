Specifying and designing an OS is a highly creative task in **Software Engineering**.

The internal structure of different OSs can vary widely.
We start by defining the goals and specifications of the OS. This may be affected by the hardware and target system type. We have 2 kinds of goals when considering this:
+ **User Goals** - The OS should be convenient, intuitive, reliable, safe, and fast.
+ **System Goals** - The OS should be easy to design, implement, and maintain. It should also be flexible, reliable, error-free, and efficient.

It is important to separate the **policy** - *what* will be done - from the **mechanism** - *how* it will be done. This allows maximum flexibility if policy decisions are changed later.
