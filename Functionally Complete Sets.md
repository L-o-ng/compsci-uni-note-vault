#definition 

Any logic circuit can be constructed from AND, OR, and NOT operations. They are a **functionally** **complete** **set**. 
It is formally defined as ==a set of boolean operators which can be used to express all possible truth tables by combining operators in the set into a boolean expression.==
A combination of NOR gates can form AND, OR, and NOT gates, so they alone are a functionally complete sets.
