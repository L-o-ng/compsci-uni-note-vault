A **MUX**, or **Multiplexor**, chooses 1 of many inputs to *steer* to its *single output* under the direction of **control inputs**: the **selector**.
	If the input to a circuit can come from several places, for example, a *MUX* is one way to funnel the multiple sources selectively to the single input.

A multiplexor has $k+2^k$ inputs and 1 output.
The first $k$ inputs - the selector $S$, represent a **binary number**.
The *output* takes the value of one of the remaining $2^k$ inputs: **the one indexed by the selector**.
