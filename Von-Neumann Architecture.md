The Von-Neumann Architecture is a fundamental computer architecture, or a stored program architecture.
+ The stored program and the data are both held in memory.
+ It allows for self modifying programs.
## Bottleneck
The Von-Neumann Bottleneck is the limitation of the data transfer rate between the CPU and memory.
This resulted in the use of CPU caches, either on-chip or close.
