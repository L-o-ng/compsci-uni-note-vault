## Terms
Individual contributions are called **terms**. The $i$-th contribution will be defined with the subscript index $i$. A similar notation can be used for the $n$-th term. Terms can be named; for example: $l_{i}, a_{n}$.
## Sequence
The *terms* of a finite or infinite [[Summations|summation]] form a sequence. For example:
$$
\frac{1}{1^{4}}+\frac{1}{2^{4}}+\frac{1}{3^{4}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n^{4}}+\frac{1}{(n+1)^{4}}+\cdots
$$
Note that this can also be written as:
$$
a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\dots+a_{n}+a_{n+1}+\dots,\space a_{j}:= \frac{1}{j^{4}}
$$
This is called a **series**.
## Sum
The **sum** of a series is its *value*. We have $S=\frac{\pi^4}{90}$ in the above example.
## Finite Series
A **finite series** contains a finite number of terms; the index runs over a finite number of values. We can use [[Summations#Sums and Sigma Notation|sigma notation]] to represent a summation.
$$
S_{N}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}a_{n}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\dots+a_{N}
$$
## Infinite Series
An infinite series contains an infinite number of terms; for example:
$$
S=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}=a_{1}+a_{2}+\dots
$$
## In General
Generally, we can specify the terms:
+ By explicitly listing the values for a finite series.
+ By an explicit formula.
+ By a recurrence relation.
