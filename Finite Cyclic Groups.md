See [[Groups#Finite Groups]] for a quick example of [[#Modulo Arithmetic]].
## Modulo Arithmetic
Give $n \in \Bbb{N},n\geq 1\text{ and }a \in \Bbb{Z}$ there is a remainder $r$ between 0 and $n-1$ if we divide $a$ by $n$.
We write $a(\operatorname{mod}n)$ for this remainder.

We can call this group $\Bbb{Z}_{n}=\{ 0,1,2,\dots,n-1 \},\bullet=+,\operatorname{mod}n$
This is called the **cyclic group of order n**.
## Order
A **finite group** with $n$ elements is said to have *order* $n$.
