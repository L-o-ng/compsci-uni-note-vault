#definition 

In Manhattan, the streets are laid out in a grid.
To get anywhere, you therefore have to travel some distance North/South and some distance East/West.
This gives rise to the Manhattan Distance, $$d_{M}((x_{1},\dots,x_{n}))=\sum_{i}|x_{i}|$$
This satisfies all the [[Generalised Norms|axioms]] of a norm, so it is one.
