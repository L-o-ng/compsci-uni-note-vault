+ **Directed Graphs**, or *Digraphs* - Edges can have *directions*:
	+ The Web Graph - vertices are pages and edges are hyperlinks;
	+ The Precedence Graph - vertices are program statements, edges are execution order;
	+ The Influence Graph - vertices are people in the group, edges reflect *influences*.
+ **Multi-Graphs** - *Multiple* edges are allowed between 2 vertices:
	+ The Air Link Graph - several different airlines can fly between 2 towns.
+ **Pseudo-Graphs** - Edges of the form $uu$, called *loops*, are allowed:
	+ The Region Graph in Computer Graphics - vertices are connected regions, edges signify that you can get from one vertex to the other by crossing a fence.
+ **Vertex- or Edge-Weighted Graphs** - Vertices and/or edges have weights:
	+ The Road Map Graph - weights on edges are distances.

By default, all our graphs are **simple un/directed** graphs.

In this way, graphs can be useful for expressing *conflicting* situations between objects, or analysing strategies and solutions.
