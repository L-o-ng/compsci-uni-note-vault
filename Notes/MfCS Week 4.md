1) 
	1) $\{ (1,2,3),(1,0,1) \}$
		1) The set does not form a basis as 2 vectors are not sufficient to span the entire 3D plane.
		2) A strict subset cannot form a basis as  < 2 vectors will also not be sufficient.
		3) A superset can form a basis as > 2 vectors, provided they are linearly independent, can span the entire space.
		4) The last point cannot be true as a superset can form a basis.
	2) $\{(1,2),(1,0),(2,4)\}$
		1) The set does not form a basis as 2 of the vectors are linearly dependent.
		2) A strict subset of any combination from this set barring the combination of the linearly dependent vectors forms a basis.
		3) A superset cannot form a basis as the set has linearly dependent vectors.
		4) Point 4 hence cannot be true.
	3) $\{ (1,0,2),(1,2,-1),(1,-2,5) \}$
		1) The set does not form a basis as $2(1,0,2)-(1,2,-1)=(1,-2,5)$.
		2) A strict subset cannot form a basis as < 3 vectors are not sufficient to span a 3D plane.
		3) A strict superset cannot form a basis due to linear dependency.
		4) Point 4 is therefore true.
2) $$\array{\text{Let }S=\{ \mathbf{s_{1}},\mathbf{s_{2}},\dots \mathbf{s_{n}} \}\\\text{Then the span is: }\{ a\mathbf{s_{i}}:a \in \mathbb{R}.1\le \mathbf{i} \le \mathbf{n} \}}$$
3) $$\array{\text{Let }S \text{ be a basis of a vector space } V\\\text{Suppose there is a vector }a \in V:a=x_{1}\mathbf{s}_{1}+\dots+x_{n}\mathbf{s}_{n}\space\And \space y_{1}\mathbf{s}_{1}+\dots+y_{n}\mathbf{s}_{n}\\a-a=(x_{1}-y_{1})\mathbf{s}_{1}+\dots+(x_{n}-y_{n})\mathbf{s}_{n}=0\\\therefore 0=\text{some combination of non-zero scalars}\\\text{This contradicts the theorem that the only zero-vector in }S\text{ is (0,0,0,...)} }$$
