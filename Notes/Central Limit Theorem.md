This is probably the **most important theorem** in probability!

>Consider IID random variables $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ . Suppose all $X_{i}$ have distribution $F$ with $E(X_{i})=\mu$ and $V(X_{i})=\sigma^{2}$ and let $\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$. $$\text{As }n \to \infty,\text{ we will have }\bar{X}\sim N\left( \frac{\mu,\sigma^{2}}{n} \right)$$

More simply, the CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately a [[Normal Distribution|Normal Distribution]] if the sample is large enough.
This explains why so many things in the real world appear to be normally distributed: many are sums of independent variables!
