The OS manages the system's memory resources to allocate it to the right processes at the right time.
It:
+ Keeps track of what memory is in use and what memory is free;
+ Allocates free memory to processes when needed;
+ Deallocates memory from waiting/exited processes;
+ Decides which processes and data to move into/out of memory.
