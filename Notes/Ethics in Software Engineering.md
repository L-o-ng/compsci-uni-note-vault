## Code of Ethics
The code of ethics is *not* a formal checklist *nor* exhaustive.
It is to help us develop an understanding of what is appropriate.
The rules can only be used effectively by people of good judgement, which is acquired through experience, good habits, and conscious attention to ethical issues. Exemplary software engineers tend to have:
+ A strong sense of individual responsibility;
+ An acute awareness of the world around them;
+ Brutal honesty;
+ Resilience under pressure;
+ Heightened sense of fairness;
+ Attention to detail.
