Consider the following:

Event $A$ is happening with probability:
$$
P(A)=\frac{|A|}{|S|}
$$
Another event $B$ is happening with probability:
$$
P(B)=\frac{|B|}{|S|}
$$
The probability of occurrence of $A$ and $B$ is $P(A \cap B)$ 
The probability of occurrence of $A$ or $B$ is $P(A \cup B)$ = $P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
