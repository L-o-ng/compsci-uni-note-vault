Digital design principles help humans to manage the complexity of huge numbers of elements interacting with each-other. 
+ **Abstraction** - hiding unimportant elements.
+ **Discipline** - restricting design choices to make things easier to model, design, and combine.
## The Three Ys
+ **Hierarchy**: Dividing a system into modules and submodules.
+ **Modularity**: Well-defined functions and interfaces for modules.
+ **Regularity**: Encouraging uniformity so modules can be swapped or reused.
