#linker 
## Etymology
>The branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, and solids (originally one of the four subjects of the quadrivium). In later use also (from the 19th cent.): a generalization of this to spaces of more than three dimensions.

Geometry concerns the length of vectors; **norms**, and angles *between* vectors.
