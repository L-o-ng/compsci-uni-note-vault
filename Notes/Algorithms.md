#notes 

An algorithm is a ==method== or ==process== that can be followed to solve a problem.
It has 4 properties:
+ Correctness
+ Composed of *concrete, unambiguous* steps
+ The number of steps must be finite
+ Must terminate

## RAM Model of Computation

A **Random Access Machine** is a simplified model of computation that can be used to compute efficiency.
+ Memory consists of an infinite array.
+ Instructions are executed sequentially, one at a time.
+ All instructions take unit time. Running time is the number of instructions executed.
