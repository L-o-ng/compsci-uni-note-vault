#definition 

Consider IID random variables $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ . Suppose that all the $X_{i}$ have distribution $F$ with $E(X_{i})=\mu$. Let $\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$. We will have:
$$
P\left( \lim_{ n \to \infty } \left( \frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\dots+X_{n}}{n} \right)=\mu \right)=1
$$

This essentially says that if we draw observations at random from **any population** with finite mean $\mu$, as the number of observations drawn *increases*, the mean $\bar{x}$ of the observed values converges to the mean $\mu$ of the population.
