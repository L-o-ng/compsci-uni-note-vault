Systems programming involves the development of the individual pieces of software that allow an entire system to function as a single unit.
It aims to produce software and software platforms which:
+ provide services to other software;
+ are performance constrained;
+ are both.
This require a great degree of hardware awareness and efficient usage of available resources because:
+ Software itself is performance critical;
+ Efficiency improvements lead to savings of time/money.
