#notes 

A transistor is an electronically-controlled switch that turns on or off when voltage or current is applied to a control terminal. They are the building blocks of almost all digital systems.
The most common transistor is the **MOFSET**, or the **Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor**.

Transistors are used to form [[Logic Gates|logic gates]].

## Adding in a Circuit
[[Logic Gates]] can be combined to form a circuit to add numbers.
