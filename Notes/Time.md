How might we measure how good this algorithm is?
+ First we have to decide upon the **resource of interest**:
	+ *time* taken, perhaps after being implemented.
	+ *amount of memory* used, perhaps after being implemented.
	+ *ease* of implementation.
	+ amount of memory used to *store* the implemented program.
## The Meaning of Time
Questions arise when thinking about how we would measure time:
1) What do we mean by the time taken by an algorithm?
2) Isn't the time taken by an implementation of the algorithm more important?
3) Surely the time taken by an implementation is dependent upon the language and architecture?
We can answer these through the [[Analysis of Algorithms]] - an increasingly important research area.
