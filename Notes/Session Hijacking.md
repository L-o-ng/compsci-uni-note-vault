## Cookies
A **cookie** is a way for a server to store information on the local host, which can be loaded each time the host visits. This is helpful for the session ID, which is then managed by the server.

## Cookie Stealing
An attacker can steal cookies locally or via XSS and can subsequently access all the information, and replay authentication information.
