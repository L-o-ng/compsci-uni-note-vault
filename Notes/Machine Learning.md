>A computer program is said to learn from **experience** $E$ with respect to some class of **tasks** $T$ and **performance measure** $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$ as measured by $P$ improves with experience $E$.

Machine learning is the study of algorithms that improve over task $T$, with respect to performance measure $P$, based on experience $E$.
A well-defined learning task is thus given by $\langle T,P,E \rangle$
