Memory is a finite resource and needs to be managed as meticulously as the CPU in order to ensure efficiency is maximised.
The main memory is usually partitioned into **two** partitions:
+ Kernel processes are held in one partition;
+ User processes are held in another.
Each partition is contained in a single [[Contiguous Memory Allocation|contiguous]] section of memory.
