See [[Functionally Complete Sets]].

We have propositional logic connectives: $\{ \wedge,\vee,¬,\implies,\iff \}$.
We could, however, have chosen *other* connectives.

We say that a set $C$ of logical connectives is **functionally complete** if any propositional formula is *equivalent* to one constructed using *only* the connectives from $C$.
In fact, ${\{ \wedge,\vee,¬ \}}$ is functionally complete.
