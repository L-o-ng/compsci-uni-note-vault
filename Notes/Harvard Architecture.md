![[Harvard Architecture.png]]

Much like the [[Von-Neumann Architecture]], but with the data memory and instruction memory separated with their own buses.
Most computers have a modified Harvard architecture - the CPU cache separates instructions and data, but main memory is not split.

The [[ATmega328P]] microcontroller in Arduinos uses this architecture.
