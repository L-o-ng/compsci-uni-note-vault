In theoretical computer science, there is a branch that classifies the complexity of various problems according to the amount of computation required to solve them, or memory required for the computation, grows as a function of the input size.

The stark distinction between logarithmic memory, polynomial memory, and exponential memory requirements is one of the key elements in understanding computational complexity.
