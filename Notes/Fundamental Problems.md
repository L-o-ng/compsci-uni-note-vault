All scientific disciplines can be said to have the solution of problems as their goal.
Computer science is more interested in the process of finding that solution.
## In General
Solutions to computer science problems:
+ involve some computational device.
+ demands of the solution have to be met in practice.
The notions of:
+ **computation**
+ **resource**
+ **correctness**
are thus all central in computer science.
## Additional complications
Computer science is often concerned with the solution of real problems, but where the problem being solved is actually an [[Abstraction]].
## Notes
+ [[Decision Problems]]
+ [[Search Problems]]
+ [[Decision vs Search]]
+ [[Optimisation Problems]]
+ [[Describing Algorithms]]
