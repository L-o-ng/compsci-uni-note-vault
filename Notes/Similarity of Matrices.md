#definition 

Square matrices $A, B$ are called *similar* if $A=P^{-1}BP$ for some invertible $P$.
Also note that if $A=P^{-1}BP$ then $B=Q^{-1}AQ,Q=P^{-1}$.

Similar matrices have in common their:
+ [[Determinants]]
+ Trace
+ [[Rank Nullity Theorem|Rank and Nullity]]
+ [[Characteristic Equations]]
+ [[Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues]]
+ Dimensions of corresponding eigenspaces

So, if $A,B$ are *similar* then:
+ $\det A=\det B$.
+ $A$ is invertible $\iff$ $B$ is invertible
However, $\det A=\det B \cancel{\implies}A\text{ is similar to }B$
