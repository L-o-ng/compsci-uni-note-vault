## Graph Isomorphism
>Two graphs $G=(V,E)$ and $G'=(V',E')$ are **isomorphic** if there exists a *bijective* function $f:V \to V'$ such that for every $u,v \in V$ we have $uv \in E\iff f(u)f(v)\in E'$. Then we write $G \ismorph G'$.

In other words, $G \ismorph G'$ when:
+ There exists a correspondence between vertices of $G,G'$ which maintains the "neighbourhood" property;
+ There is a renaming of $G'$ such that it coincides with $G$.
Isomorphism is an equivalence relationship:
+ $G \ismorph G$: every graph is isomorphic to itself;
+ If $G_{1} \ismorph G_{2}$ and $G_{2} \ismorph G_{3}$ then $G_{1} \ismorph G_{3}$.
