**RAID**, or Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, is a disk-management schema. It works on the basis that multiple drives provide reliability via redundancy. It is organised into six levels. By storing redundant data, RAID schemes improve performance and reliability across a storage network:
+ Mirroring/shadowing keeps a duplicate of each disk.
+ Block-interleaved parity uses much less redundancy.
