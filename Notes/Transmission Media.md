Transmission media provides the **channels** over which the message travels from *source* to *destination*. Data appears as **signals** in transmission media.
## Types of Transmission
### Copper Cables
Copper cables transmit **electric** signal pulses.
**Transmit Rates**:
+ Category 3 UTP (10Mbps);
+ Category 5 UTP (1000Mbps);
+ Category 6 UTP (1000Mbps).
#### Coaxial Cables

#### Shielded Twisted-Pair Cables

#### Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cables

### Optic Fibres
**Optic Fibres** transmit *light* pulses. They have a *high* transmit rate: up to 100Gbps; and a low error rate: with **repeaters** spaced along the cable, they can travel very long distances. They are also immune to electromagnetic noise.
#### Single Mode

### Radio Frequencies
RF signals are carried over the *EM spectrum*. There are no physical wires. Signal propagation is affected by the environment, via:
+ Reflection;
+ Obstruction by objects;
+ Interference.

RF signals are classified into 3 groups:
+ **Very Short Distance** signals like *Bluetooth* cover 5-10 metres;
+ **LAN** signals like *WiFi* cover 10 metres up to a few hundred;
+ **Wide-Area** signals like *cellular/mobile* networks cover tens of miles.
### Satellite Radio Channels
There are 2 types of satellite used for communication:
+ **Geostationary** satellites orbit ~36000km above Earth and are stationary relative to the ground. They are used where cable-based access is unavailable;
+ **Low-Earth Orbit** satellites orbit up to 2000km above Earth and move over the surface.
