## Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
![[Digital Subscriber Line.png]]
A **DSL** network access uses an existing telephone line to a central office DSLAM. Data over the DSL phone line goes to the internet. Voice goes to the telephone net.
A DSL is an example of **asymmetric access** - downstream and upstream rates are different:
+ <2.5Mbps upstream (typically <1Mbps)
+ <24Mbps downstream (typically <10)
## Cable Network

A **HFC** - Hybrid Fibre Coax - is also asymmetric, with up to 42.8Mbps down, 30.7Mbps up. It is a network of cable with a fibre connection between homes and the ISP. Homes *share* access to the cable headend. This is unlike DSL, which has dedicated central access.
## Enterprise Access Networks - Ethernet

Ethernet is a fast connection (up to 10Gbps) widely used in companies, universities, and homes. Today, end systems are typically connected by Ethernet switches.
## Wireless

A **shared wireless access network** connects end systems to the router via a *base station*, also called the **wireless access point**.
Wireless LANs are often used in homes, reaching between 54-1300Mbps.
A Wide-Area Network, or **WAN** are provided by a Telco/mobile operator and operate over 10s of kilometres. They typically reach between 1-10Mbps.
