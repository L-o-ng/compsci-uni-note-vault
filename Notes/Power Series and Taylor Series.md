Power series are series of the form $P(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}x^{n}$.
We refer to $\{ b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\dots \}$ as the **coefficients** of the power series $P(x)$.

The [[Convergence#Geometric Series|Geometric Series]] and [[Calculus on Series#Example - the Arithmetico-geometric Series|Arithmetico-Geometric Series]] containing the variable $x$ are examples of power series.

We expect these series to converge for some values of $x$ near 0. When the series converges, the partial sums $P_{K}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{K-1}b_{n}x^{n}$ will be increasingly good approximations of $P(x)$. This provides a useful approach to calculating and studying functions that can be written as power series.
For example, we saw for the geometric series that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}= \frac{1}{1-x}$ so $1+x+x^{2}$ can be used as an approximation for $\frac{1}{1-x}$.
