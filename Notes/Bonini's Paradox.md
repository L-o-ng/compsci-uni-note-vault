Bonini's Paradox is the idea that when you try to make a detailed model of something complex (like the human brain or an economy), the model itself becomes just as complicated as the real thing—making it just as hard to understand.

If you simplify the model to make it easier to understand, it stops accurately representing the real thing. So either the model is too complex to be useful, or it's too simple to be accurate.
