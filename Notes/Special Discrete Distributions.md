## Discrete Uniform Distribution
The simplest discrete random variable.
Assumes only a finite number of possible values, each with equal probability.
A random variable $X$ has discrete uniform distribution if each of the $n$ values in its range $x_{1},x_{2},\dots x_{n}$ has equal probability:
>Suppose random variable $X$ has uniform distribution. The PMF of $X$ is given by $(X \textasciitilde \operatorname{Uni}(n))$:$$P(X=k)=f(k)=\frac{1}{n}$$
