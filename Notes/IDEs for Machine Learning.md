Python's package `scikit-learn` can be used to obtain "toy" datasets. These are represented in a *tabular* form:

For a supervised learning task, the tabular dataset contains $X$ - the independent variables - and $Y$ - the dependent variables; for an **unsupervised** task, the dataset contains $X$ only.
