1. In how many ways can 4 out of 10 people be seated on a bench that has 4 seats?
	1. $10\times 9\times 8\times 7=5040$
2. Evaluate the following:
	1. $P(8,3)$
		1. 336
	2. $P(6,4)$
		1. 360
	3. $P(15, 1)$
		1. 15
	4. $P(3,3)$
		1. 6
3. Out of 5 mathematicians and 7 physicists, a committee of 2 mathematicians and 3 physicists is to be formed. In how many ways can this be done in each of the following cases:
	1. Any mathematician and physicist can be included
		1. $5\times 4 + 7\times 6\times 5=230$
	2. One particular physicist must be on the committee
		1. $5\times 4+ 6\times 5=50$
	3. Two particular mathematicians cannot be on the committee
		1. $3\times 2+7\times 6\times 5=216$
4. It is required to seat 5 cats and 4 dogs in a row so that the dogs occupy the even places. How many arrangements are possible?
	1. $5!\times 4! =2880$
5. How many 4 digit numbers can be formed in each of the following 3 cases with the digits 0-9:
	1. Repetitions are allowed:
		1. $10\times 10\times 10\times 10=10000$
	2. Repetitions are not allowed
		1. $10\times 9\times 8\times 7=5040$
	3. The last digit must be 0 and repetitions are not allowed
		1. $10\times 9\times 8\times 1 =720$
6. In how many ways can 7 people be seated at a round table (rotations do not change the arrangement) if:
	1. They can sit anywhere
		1. $\frac{7!}{7}=720$
	2. 2 particular people cannot sit together
		1. $720 - (6-1)!\times 2=480$
7. 5 red marbles, 2 white, and 3 blue are arranged in a row. If all marbles of the same color are not distinguishable, how many different arrangements are possible?
	1. $\frac{10!}{5!3!2!}=2520$
8. How many different salads can be made from 5 different type of leaves?
	1. 31
9. Evaluate the following:
	1. $(^7_{4})$
		1. 35
	2. $(^6_{5})$
		1. 6
	3. $(^4_{4})$
		1. 1
10. A box contains red and blue marbles. One marble is drawn at random from the box. If it is red, you win £1. If it is blue, you win nothing. You can choose between 2 boxes. Box A contains 3 red marbles and 2 blue ones. Box B contains 30 red marbles and 20 blue ones. Which box offers a better chance of winning, or are they the same?
	1. The chance of winning is the same.
11. In a game of poker, 5 cards are drawn from a pack of 52 well-shuffled cards. Find the probability that:
	1. 4 are aces
		1. $\frac{(^4_{4})(^{48}_{1})}{(^{52}_{5})} =\frac{1}{54145}$
	2. 4 are aces and 1 is a king
		1. $\frac{1}{649740}$
	3. 3 are tens and 2 are jacks
		1. $\frac{1}{108290}$
	4. A 9, 10, jack, queen, and king are obtained in any order
		1. $\frac{64}{162435}$
