## Compilation
Compilation turns *all* of the program into machine code to be run on a specific machine.
## Interpretation
Interpretation translates and runs one or a few instructions at a time, as is needed, with the translations interspersed with the activity of the program itself.
## Compiled vs Interpreted
+ Compiled programs tend to run faster.
+ Compilation spends time analysing and optimising.
+ Compilation avoids some runtime errors.
Whereas,
+ Interpreted programs tend to use memory better.
+ Interpreted programs facilitate development.
## Spectrum of Possibilities
**Bytecode**: programs are compiled into this intermediate code which is fast to interpret, then translated by a portable virtual machine.
**Dynamic/Just In Time Compilation**: source programs only semi-compile, with completion only after initial execution, with the use of runtime libraries.
