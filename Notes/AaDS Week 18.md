1) Let $G$ be a connected graph, and $v$ be a vertex of degree 1 in $G$. Prove that $G-v$ is also connected.
	1) Since $v$ has degree 1, it is on the end of a path including it, and is not part of any other paths. Therefore, removing it only shortens paths ending on $v$ and does not interact with other paths in $G$. This means $G-v$ must also be connected.
2) Which of the following graphs are Eulerian/Hamiltonian?
	1) $Q_{3}$
		1) Eulerian: ❌
		2) Hamiltonian: ✅
	2) $Q_{4}$
		1) Eulerian: ✅
		2) Hamiltonian: ✅
	3) $K_{3}$
		1) 
	4) $K_{4}$
