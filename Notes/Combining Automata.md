We want to implement an operation on languages by combining the corresponding automata. Given $L_{1}$ recognised by $M_{1}=\{ Q_{1},\Sigma,\updelta_{1},q_{1},F_{1} \}$ and $L_{2}$ recognised by $M_{2}=\{ Q_{2},\Sigma,\updelta_{2},q_{2},F_{2} \}$. We want to combine $M_{1},M_{2}$ into a new automaton $M$ that would recognise $L_{1}\cup L_{2}$. todo!
