Events can occur independently of one-another. Two event are independent if and only if:
$$
P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)
$$
Equivalently, if two events are independent, then the probability of event $A$ will not change given event $B$ happens:
$$
P(A|B)=P(A)\implies P(A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\implies \underline{P(A)\times P(B)}
$$
So, if $P(A|B)=P(A)$ then $A,B$ are independent.
