A **graph** is a mathematical model that represents objects and their relations, where objects can be any entity, and relations lie between pairs of objects.
## Formal Definition
>A graph $G$ is a pair $(V(G),E(G))$, where $V(G)$ is a **nonempty** set of **vertices**, or *nodes*; and $E(G)$ is a set of *unordered pairs* $\{ u,v \}$ with $u,v \in V(G),u \neq v$, called the *edges* of $G$.
### Syntactic Semantics
+ $V(G)$ can be infinite, but graphs in this linker will be **finite**.
+ If no confusion will arise, we write $uv$ instead of $\{ u,v \}$.
+ If the graph $G$ is clear from the context, we write $V,E$ instead of $V(G),E(G)$.

It often helps to draw graphs:
+ Represent each vertex with a point;
+ Represent each edge with a line/curve connecting the corresponding points.
