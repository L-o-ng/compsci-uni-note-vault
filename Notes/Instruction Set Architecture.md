#notes 

The **ISA** is the interface between hardware and software:
+ It is the view the programmer has of hardware.
+ It includes everything the programmer needs to know to program the processor.
The **ISA** includes:
+ Organisation/structure of programmable storage/useable memory.
+ Instruction Sets and formats for using the processor.
+ Modes of addressing and accessing data items within memory, like absolute, indirect, offsets, etc.
+ Process of execution: [[Computation in a Simple Processor|Fetch, Decode, Fetch, Execute]]
## Assembly
A primary component of the ISA is its **assembly language**.
+ A high-level program is compiled into assembly.
+ Assembly language instructions are very low-level and go on to be implemented as machine code.
## Example
See [[MIPS]] for an example.
