## Input Sanitisation
### Intuition
Executable code is removed from data that should not be executable.
### Examples
+ Remove specific text from environment variables;
+ Detect SQL/JS code in web forms;
+ Look for python scripts in text files.
### Limitations
In some cases, it is useful to insert executable code at runtime.
## Close the System
### Intuition
Remove dangerous functionalities altogether
### Examples
+ Use a static website instead of a dynamic one;
+ Prevent the installation of new programs.
### Limitations
In some cases we need open systems.
## Analyse the Input
### Intuition
Find bad executable patterns in the input.
### Examples
+ **Signature Matching** - known patterns of bad code is searched for in the input;
	+ *Pros*: usable; ie all detections correspond to bad code.
	+ *Cons*: can miss new attacks.
+ **Anomaly Detection** - normal behaviour is first recorded, and deviation from that behaviour is flagged.
	+ *Pros*: can catch new attacks.
	+ *Cons*: false positive risk.
### Limitations
It is very hard to automatically analyse all input: we run the risk of accidentally invoking the halting problem.
## Confine
### Intuition
Make sure that the execution of bad code has limited impact.
### Examples
+ Run programs as a normal/limited user;
+ Run executable search queries on a server with read-only capabilities.
### Limitations
The attack effectively still happens, and the system may be vulnerable to privilege escalation.
