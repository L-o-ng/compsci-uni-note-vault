In all the problem-description pages, problems and algorithms have been defined in natural language. However, our intention is to eventually implement algorithms as programs for execution by computers: there is a disconnect. 
We can move to an interim position: [[Pseudo-code]].
This will be: 
+ Sufficiently precise to: 
	+ Easily move to Python
	+ Analyse performance
+ Sufficiently flexible to: 
	+ implement our algorithms in other high-level languages.
