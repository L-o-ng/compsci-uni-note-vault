Although the covariance measure us useful in finding the association between $X,Y$, the units are difficult to interpret. To avoid this, a normalised measure is used:
>The **Correlation Coefficient** between $X,Y$ is: $$Corr(X,Y)=\rho_{XY}=\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{ V(X)V(Y) }}$$

It can be shown that this measure lies between -1 and 1. If $X,Y$ are independent then $\rho_{XY}=0$. The converse is not necessarily true, however.
