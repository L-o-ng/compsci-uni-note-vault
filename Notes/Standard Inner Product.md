$\Bbb{P}_{n}$ is the space of all polynomials of degree of at most $n$.
For vectors $\mathbf{p}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots+a_{n}x^{n}$ and $\mathbf{q}=b_{0}+b_{1}x+\dots+b_{n}x^{n}$ we define:
$$
\langle\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}\rangle=a_{0}b_{0}+a_{1}b_{1}+\dots+a_{n}b_{n}
$$
This is called the **Standard Inner Product** on $\Bbb{P}_{n}$.
Note that:
+ It is easy to see that each vector $\mathbf{p}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots+a_{n}x^{n}\in \Bbb{P}_{n}$ can be identified with the corresponding vector $(a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n})\in \Bbb{R}^{n+1}$;
+ Then, the standard inner product on $\Bbb{P}_{n}$ is the dot product on $\Bbb{R}^{n+1}$.
