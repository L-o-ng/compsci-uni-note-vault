Let $F(x)$ be differentiable.
If $F^\prime(x)=f(x)$ then $F(x)$ is an anti-derivative of $f(x)$.
## Example
If $f(x)=\cos x$ then $F(x)=\sin x$ is an anti-derivative of $f(x)$.
But, so is $G(x)=\sin x+1\text{ and }\sin x+3\text{ etc.}$ , since $G^\prime(x)=\cos x=f(x)$.
### Note
Any 2 anti-derivatives $F(x),G(x)$ differ at most by a constant.
