There are different logical models for different applications.
## Examples
+ **Classical Logic** - textbook-style logic; $a \vee \overline{a}$ always holds.
+ **Temporal Logic** - truth changes over time.
+ **Modal Logic** - Handles *possibly*, *necessarily*, and *always* truth statements.
+ **Many-Valued Logic** - Handles ideas like *true*, *false*, *unknown*, and intermediate values.
+ **Fuzzy Logic** - The standard set of truth values is $[0,1]$, and can speak about the *degree* of membership of $x \in A$.
+ **Non-Monotonic Logic** - More facts may yield fewer conclusions.
