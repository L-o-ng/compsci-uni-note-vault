An OS is a fundamental part of the computer system; it is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user and the hardware.
It:
+ Executes user programs;
+ Makes solving user problems easier;
+ Makes the computer system convenient to use;
+ Uses the resources of the system fairly and efficiently.
An OS is composed of:
+ A **Resource Allocator** - Responsible for the management of the computer system resources;
+ A **Control Program** - Controls the execution of user programs and operation of the IO devices to prevent errors and improper use of the computer;
+ An [[OS Kernel]] - The one underlying program which runs all the time.
## Use Cases
### Abstraction
An **OS** is an *abstract machine*; it:
+ Extends the basic hardware with added functionality;
+ Provides high-level abstractions;
+ Hides the details of the hardware.
### Resource Management
An **OS** is a *resource manager*; it:
+ Is responsible for allocation of resources to users and processes;
+ Ensures that:
	+ There is no starvation;
	+ There is progress;
	+ Allocation is according to some desired policy;
## Other Operations
+ Resource Management;
+ Process Management;
+ Memory Management;
+ Mass Storage Management;
+ Filesystem Management;
+ Cache Management;
+ IO Management.
