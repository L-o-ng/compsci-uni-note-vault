If there is a group sitting inside another group, it is called a subgroup.
## Definition
Let $G$ be a group with a binary operation $\bullet$. Then $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if $H$ is a subset of $G$ and $H$ is also a group with a binary operation $\bullet$.
### Checking if $H$ is a Subgroup
+ **Associativity** is automatic. If $a \bullet (b \bullet c)=(a \bullet b)\bullet c$ for all $a,b,c \in G$, then $a \bullet (b \bullet c)=(a \bullet b)\bullet c$ for all $a,b,c \in H \subset G$.
+ **Closure** - if $x,y \in H$ then we need $x \bullet y \in H$: not just $G$!
+ **Identity** - we need $e \in H$.
+ **Inverses** - if $x \in H$ we need $x^{-1} \in H$.
