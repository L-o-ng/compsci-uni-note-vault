A **DFA**, or *Deterministic Finite-State Automaton* is a 5-tuple of $Q,\Sigma,\updelta,q_{0},F$ where:
+ $Q$ is a finite set of **states**;
+ $\Sigma$ is a finite **alphabet**;
+ $\updelta:Q\times \Sigma \to Q$ is the **transition function**;
+ $q_{0}\in Q$ is the **start state**;
+ $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accept states**.
## Designing a DFA
Designing finite-state automata is a creative process, similar to programming. There are no recipes, but looking at many examples helps.
