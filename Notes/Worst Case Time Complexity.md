#definition 

>The **worst-case time complexity** of an algorithm can be expressed in terms of the *largest* number of basic operations used by the algorithm when the input has a particular size.

Worst-case analysis tells us how many operations an algorithm requires to guarantee that it will produce a solution.
The worst-case time analysis is a standard way to estimate the efficiency of algorithms - usually, "time complexity" and "worst-case time complexity" are interchangeably used in this way.
