## Logical/Physical Addressing
Memory is made up of many [[Memory Cells]]. The concept of a logical address space that is bound to a separate physical address space is central to proper memory management.
+ **Logical Address** - Generated by the CPU. This can also be referred to as a *virtual address*.
+ **Physical Address** - Address seen by the memory unit.
A user application deals with *logical* addresses; it never knows the real physical address.
## Memory Management Unit
The **MMU** is a hardware device that maps virtual addresses to real ones at runtime.
Consider a simple scheme where the value in the relocation register is added to every address generated by a user process at the time it is sent to memory. The base register is now called a **relocation register**.

## Memory Protection
Relocation registers are used to protect user processes from each other, and from changing OS code and data:
+ The base register contains the value of the smallest physical address;
+ The limit register contains the range of logical addresses - each logical address must be less than the limit register;
+ The MMU maps logical addresses *dynamically*.

### Implementation
See [[Memory Fragmentation]].

Memory protection is implemented by associating a protection bit with each frame.
A **valid/invalid bit** is attached to each entry in the page table:
+ **Valid** indicated that the associated page is in the process' logical address space and is thus a legal page;
+ **Invalid** indicates that the page is not in the process' logical address space.
