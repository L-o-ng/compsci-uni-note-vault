It is the closest to a memory abstraction of a CPU.

**Declarative** programs say *what* rather than *how*.
This includes: 
+ **functional** languages, like Lisp, Haskell, ...
  Programs are defined as mathematical functions.
+ **logic** languages, like Prolog, Poplog, ...
  Programs specify a logical solution.

**Data-Oriented** languages include SQL, dBase, ...
Programs work with data via manipulating and searching relations and tables.

**Scripting** languages include Javascript and Perl.
They are designed to automate frequently used tasks that involve calling or passing commands to external programs.

**Assembly** languages like [[MIPS]] are low-level and provide an interface between machine code and high-level languages.

**Concurrent** languages include Ada, Clik, Erlang, Java, ...
They provide facilities for concurrency, managing multithreading or shared memory.

**Dataflow** languages include Vizsim, Oz, Openwire, ...
The program is specified by flows of data, usually visual.

**Fourth-Generation** languages include SAS, Visual Foxpro, ...
They are high-level languages built around databases.

**List-Based** languages like Lisp, TCL, ... are built around the list data structure and so are popular for AI research.

**Visual** languages include Lava, Prograph, PIet, ...
They allow the user to specify programs using visual representation.
