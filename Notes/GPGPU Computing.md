A **GPGPU** is a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit.

GPUs traditionally used to deal with graphics, with 1 thread per pixel.
These can actually be used as computation threads, resulting in a massively parallel desktop computer.

GPGPUs are [[Multi-Core Computing|shared memory]] devices, and programming for such a device can be difficult - poor programs may actually run *slower*!
