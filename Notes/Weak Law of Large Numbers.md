#definition 

Consider IID random variables $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ . Suppose all $X_{i}$ have distribution $F$ with $E(X_{i})=\mu$ and $V(X_{i})=\sigma^{2}$ and let $\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$. For any $\varepsilon>0$, we will have:
$$
P(|\bar{X}-\mu|\geq\varepsilon)\to 0\text{ as }n \to +\infty
$$
This can be proved via [[Chebyshev's Inequality]].
