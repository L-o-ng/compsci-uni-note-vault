**REST** is an architectural style for web-services.
+ It provides interoperability: language independent.
+ It uses HTTP methods.
+ It is structured like a function call: 
	+ Parameters are provided in the URL (GET) or body (POST)
	+ Results are provided in the body.
+ REST web-services can be published as an API.
