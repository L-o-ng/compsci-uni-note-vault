Suppose we have 2 [[Linear Maps|linear maps]] $f$ and $g$ represented by matrices $A$ and $B$.
	Q: What is the matrix for $(f \circ g)(\mathbf{v})=f(g(\mathbf{v}))$?

We need to find the **images** of the *basis vectors*.
+ $B$ columns contain images of **basis** **vectors** under $\mathbf{g}$
+ So, apply $A$ to columns of $B$ in turn and write as columns.
+ This gives the matrix of the the map $f \circ g$ which we write $AB$.

In other words, [[Matrix Multiplication|multiply the matrices]] $A \space \And \space B$
