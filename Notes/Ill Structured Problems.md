**Ill-Structured Problems** are:
+ Elusive, unbounded, without end conditions, and not understandable;
+ Requiring orientation/context;
+ Of many stakeholders;
+ Of many solutions.
They have ill defined *solution spaces*, so solving them requires an 'ill-defined' approach: only people can currently solve an ill-defined problem.
## Solving an Ill-Defined Problem
1. Generate initial boundaries;
2. From these boundaries, decompose the problem;
3. Identify potential solution criteria for these new sub-problems;
4. Obtain feedback, reconsider, and reframe.

This is an iterative process, and the findings from each run will allow for refinement and reformulation of the initial problem description and limits imposed.
## Approach to Problems
In software engineering, a good problem-solver needs:
+ A **method**, referring to a formal procedure for accomplishing a goal that is typically independent of the tools used;
+ A **tool** - an instrument/automated system for accomplishing something in a better way;
+ A **procedure**, or a combination of tools and techniques to produce a product;
+ A **paradigm** - the philosophy or approach to building the product.
