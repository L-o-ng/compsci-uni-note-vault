**STRIDE** is a threat classification acronym:
+ **S**poofing
+ **T**ampering
+ **R**epudiation
+ **I**nformation Disclosure
+ **D**enial of service
+ **E**levation of privilege
STRIDE is a helpful model to structure analysis of threats, but it is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Understanding which threats are relevant to a system helps controlling them.
## Examples
### Spoofing
Using someone else's credentials to perform an operation is a failure of identification/authentication. A weak password would be an enabling vulnerability.
### Tampering
Malicious modification of data is a failure of integrity. A lack of additional authentication for transfers would be an enabling vulnerability.
### Repudiation
Denying having performed an action is a failure of accountability/identification. Unsigned transactions would be an enabling vulnerability.
### Information Disclosure
Exposure of information to unauthorised users is a failure of confidentiality. Shoulder surfing would be an enabling vulnerability.
### Denial of Service
Denying access to a service to legitimate users is a failure of availability. Unverified installation of software would be an enabling vulnerability.
### Elevation of Privilege
An unprivileged user gaining privileged access is a failure of confinement/authentication. Unprotected caching would be an enabling vulnerability.
