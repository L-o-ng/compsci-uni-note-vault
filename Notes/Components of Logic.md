#notes 

A logic generally has **3** components:
+ **Syntax** - the definition of the well-formed formulae of the logic.
+ **Semantics** - the association of meaning and truth to the formulae of the logic.
+ **Proof System** - the manipulation of formulae according to a system of rules.

All *true* formulae should be *provable* - so we want **completeness**.
A formula that is *provable* should be *true* - so we want **soundness**.

We also want to check if a formula is true or provable with a computer, preferably quickly.
