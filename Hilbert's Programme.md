David Hilbert proposed **Hilbert's Programme**. He believed:
+ All mathematical statements could be written in a formal language and manipulated according to formal rules.
+ All true mathematical statements could be proved in the formalism.
+ There would be an algorithm to decide whether any mathematical statement is true or not.
