#definition 

Vectors are *orthogonal* (at right angles) if their dot product is 0.
Vectors are *normal* if their [[Euclidean Norm]], or $\ell_{2}$ norm, is 1.
A set of vectors is *orthonormal* if they are all orthogonal and normal.

It is often useful to have an **orthonormal basis** for a [[Vector Spaces|Vector Space]].
