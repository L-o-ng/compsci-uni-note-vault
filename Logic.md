Every logic comprises of:
+ A **formal language** for making statements about certain objects.
+ A **formal system** for *reasoning* about properties of these objects.
English is too rich to be formally described; the meaning of sentences can be ambiguous, and paradoxes can be formed, so we need a different way to express logic.

---

Once the *formulae* of a logic have been defined, there are 2 fundamental aspects:
+ A system of *deduction* by which **proofs** can be constructed.
	+ So, a **proof system**.
+ A notion of *meaning* by which the truth of some property of some object can be determined.
	+ So, its **semantics**.
