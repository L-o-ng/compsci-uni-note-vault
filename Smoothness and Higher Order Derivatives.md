For a function $f$, the $k^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k)}$ is the function obtained by differentiating $k$ times.
So, $$\array{f^{(0)}=f \\ f^{(1)}=f^\prime \\ f^{(2)}=f{^\prime}{^\prime} \\ \text{etc... : Note that }f^{(2)}\ne f^2}$$
A function that is continuous is in the class $C^0$.
A function that is continuous **and** has a continuous derivative is in the class $C^1$.
## Example
$$f(x)=\begin{cases}
x &: x > 0 \\
0 &: x \le 0
\end{cases}\quad\text{Is in }C^0\text{ but not in }C^1\text{.}$$
A function $f$ such that $f^\prime, f{^\prime}{^\prime}, f{^\prime}{^\prime}{^\prime} \dots,f^{(k)}$ exist and are continuous is in class $C^k$.
A function $f$ such that derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous is in class $C^\infty$, also called **smooth**.
	Polynomials, and $\sin,\cos$ are *smooth*, for example.
