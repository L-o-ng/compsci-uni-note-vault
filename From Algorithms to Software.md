**Algorithms** are elusive and informal objects.
A **programming language** provides a means for translating an algorithm into a form suitable for execution by a computer.

An algorithms is *not* a computer program.
+ A program is written in an explicitly defined language.
+ There are an infinite number of implementations of any algorithm.

So, giving a formal definition of an algorithm is a catch 22:
+ If we can formally define one, we have a programming language, but an algorithm is supposed to be *different* to a programming language!
