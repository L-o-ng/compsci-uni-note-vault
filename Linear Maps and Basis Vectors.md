See [[Linear Maps]] and [[Basis Representation]] for more details.

Every vector $\mathbf{v}$ can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors $\mathbf{s}_{i} \in S$.
If we apply a linear map $f$ then:
$$f(\mathbf{v})=f\left( \sum_{i=1}^na_{i}\mathbf{s}_{i} \right)=\sum_{i=1}^na_{i}f(\mathbf{s}_{i})$$
So, ==a linear map is characterised by its action on basis vectors.==
