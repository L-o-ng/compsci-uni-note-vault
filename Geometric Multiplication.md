## Definition
Let $z=re^{i\theta}, \space w=\rho e^{i\chi}\text{ then }zw=r \rho e^{i(\theta+\chi)}$ :

So, multiplication by a complex number does the following: 
1) Rotates anticlockwise by angle $\theta=\arg(z)$
2) Expands from origin by a factor $r=|z|$

## Example
Multiply $w$ by $2i=2e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}}$: 
This means,
1) rotate $w$ by $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
2) expand by 2.
