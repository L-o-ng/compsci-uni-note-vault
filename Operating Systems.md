The job of an operating system is to manage **all** of a machine's resources.
+ Provides the interface between hardware and software.
+ Needed as many concurrently executing tasks need managing.
Abstracts the hardware for applications:
+ All application access to hardware is through the OS using [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]] instructions and **system calls**.
+ OS provides **data security**.
OS **kernel**:
+ Main component of the OS.
+ Loaded at boot, so has total control of CPU.
OS main functions:
+ **Virtualisation** - disk access/VMware
+ Starts and stops programs - frees memory and suspends execution.
+ Manages memory - hides actual execution locations
+ Handles input and output - interrupts
+ Maintains filesystem - access restrictions
+ Deals with networking and provides security.
+ Facilitates error handling and recovery.
