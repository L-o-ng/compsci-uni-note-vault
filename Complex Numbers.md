To every point $(x,y)$ in the plane we associate a **complex number** $x+iy,(x,y \in \mathbb{R})$
+ $\mathbb{C}$ = Set of all complex numbers.
+ $(x,y)$ plane = Complex plane, or Argand plane.

## Operations
For $\mathbb{C}$, we have $+,-,\times,\textdiv$.
==Addition and Subtraction work as expected:==
$$(3+4i)+(-6+2i)=3-6+4i+2i=-3+(4+2)i=-3+6i$$
Multiplication also works as expected, except for 1 new rule:
$$i^2=-1$$
