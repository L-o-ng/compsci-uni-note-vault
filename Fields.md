A field is much like a [[Groups|Group]], but with 2 operations. It is defined informally as a set with 2 operations defined on that set - addition and multiplication, which behave similarly for rational and real numbers, alongside the existence of an additive and multiplicative inverse.
## Axioms (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)))
+ **Associativity** of addition and multiplication: $a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$, and $a\cdot(b\cdot{c})=(a\cdot{b})\cdot{c}$.
+ **Commutativity** of addition and multiplication: $a+b=b+a\text{, and }ab=ba$.
+ **Additive and Multiplicative identity**: There exists 2 distinct elements in $F$, 0 and 1, such that $a+0=a\text{ and }a\cdot1=a$.
+ **Additive Inverses**: $\forall{a}\in{F}:a\ne0,\exists\text{ -}a\in{F}:a+\text{-}a=0$.
+ **Multiplicative Inverses**: $\forall{a}\in{F}:a\ne0,\exists{\space a^{\text{-}1}}|\frac{1}{a}\in{F}:a\cdot{a^{\text{-}1}}=1$.
+ **Distributivity** of multiplication over addition: $a\cdot(b+c)=(a\cdot{b})+(a\cdot{c})$.
