Many systems include both **CLI** and **GUI** interfaces.
+ Windows is primarily GUI with a CLI command shell.
+ UNIX and Linux-based systems have a CLI with optional GUI interfaces.
## Command Line Interface (CLI)
A **CLI** allows direct command entry:
+ It is sometimes implemented in the [[OS Kernel]], sometimes by system programs;
+ It sometimes has multiple *flavours* implemented - **shells**;
+ It primarily fetches a command from the user and executes it.
## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A **GUI** provides an intuitive desktop interface:
+ Usually optimised for mouse, keyboard, and monitor usage;
+ **Icons** represent files, programs, etc;
+ Various buttons cause various actions, such as: providing information, options, execution, etc;
