Digital Electronics refers to digital technology or circuits, which operate on digital signals.
They are usually made from large assemblies of [[Gates|gates]].

They are unlike analogue circuits which manipulate analogue signals, which are subject to ==manufacturing tolerance==, ==signal attenuation==, and ==noise==.

## Digital Signals
Digital signals are representations of analogue waves. A [[Number Systems#Binary|binary]] sequence is mapped to either the amplitude or frequency of the analogue signal.
