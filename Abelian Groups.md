In general, we do *not* require, $x \bullet y = y \bullet x \space\forall x,y \in\text{group}$.
However, this does happen to be true most of the time; a key example of the opposite is $D_{3}$ or the equilateral triangle symmetry group.
## Commutativity
Two elements $x,y$ in a group are said to *commute* if $x \bullet y =y \bullet x$.
If all pairs of elements in $G$ *commute*, then the group is called an **Abelian Group**.
### About Abelian Groups
So, 
+ $\Bbb{Z},\Bbb{Q},\Bbb{R}\Bbb{C}\text{ with }\bullet=+$,
+ $\Bbb{Q}^x,\Bbb{R}^x, \Bbb{C}^x\text{ with }\bullet=\times$,
+ The [[Symmetry as a Group#The Circle Group|Circle Group]],
are all Abelian Groups.
