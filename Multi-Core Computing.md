#notes 

More than one processor is typically integrated on one circuit.
Many cores can pull from *shared memory*, or memory can be *distributed* between many cores.
The cores are connected via an **interconnection network**, for example:
+ Ring
+ Mesh
+ Torus
+ Hypercube
This concept allows for the use of more and slower processors, and so less heat and power use in comparison to a single fast core.
