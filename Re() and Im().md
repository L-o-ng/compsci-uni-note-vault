## Definitions
Let $z=x+iy \in \mathbb{C}$ then we define:
+ $\Re(z)=x$, or the "real part" of $z$.
+ $\Im(z)=y$, or the "imaginary part" of $z$.
+ $|z|=\sqrt{ x^2+y^2 }$, or the [[Modulus|modulus]] of $z$.
+ $\overline{z}=x-iy$, or the complex conjugate of $z$, sometimes called $z^*$.

## Real and Imaginary Axis
If $\Im(z)=0\text{ ie }z=x+0i$ then $z$ is called real.
The $x\text{-axis}$ is called real.

If $\Re(z)=0\text{ ie }z=yi$ then $z$ is called purely imaginary.
The $y\text{-axis}$ is called the imaginary axis.

Note that in the complex plane:
