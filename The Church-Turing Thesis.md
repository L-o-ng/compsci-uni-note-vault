Part of [[Hilbert's Programme]] was to solve the Entsheidungsproblem which asks for:
+ An algorithm that takes an input of a description of a formal language and a mathematical statement in the language.
+ It then produces an output of either *true* or *false*, dependent on the truthiness of the statement.
Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published papers showing a general solution is impossible;
+ Turing proved his result by reformatting [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems]] into Turing machines.
+ Church created Lambda Calculus, leading to functional programming languages.

Many researchers had proposed different notions of computation - all proven to be equivalent.
The Church-Turing thesis is the *thesis* that all of these notions embody what it means to be computable. So, we have a definition of computable, and *proofs* that certain problems are unsolvable.
