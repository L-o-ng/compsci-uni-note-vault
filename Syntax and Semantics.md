#notes 

Every language has: 
+ **Syntax**: How a program is written.
+ **Semantics**: What a program means.

Informal semantics leads to problems: you can never be certain things will be the same in a different environment, or indeed that your program will do what you want at al.
In general, $$\text{Informality}\implies\text{Ambiguity}\implies\text{Divergence}\implies\text{Errors}$$
In computer science, we use:
+ **Denotational Semantics**: A program's meaning is given mathematically as a suitable mathematical structure.
+ **Operational Semantics**: A programs meaning is given in terms of the steps of a computation the program makes when it runs.
+ **Axiomatic Semantics**: A program's meaning is given indirectly in terms of a collection of logical properties it satisfies and how these properties are maintained.
