A **linear equation** in $n$ variables $x_{1},\dots,x_{n}$ is an equation of the form: $$a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\dots+a_{n}x_{n}=b$$where $a_{i}$ and $b$ are constants.
A finite set of linear equations is called a **system of linear equations**, or a **linear system**.
A general linear system can be written as: 
$$
\begin{matrix}
a_{11}x_{1} &+ &a_{12}x_{2} &+ &\dots &+ &a_{1n}x_{n} &= &b_{1} \\
a_{21}x_{1} &+ &a_{22}x_{2} &+ &\dots &+ &a_{2n}x_{n} &= &b_{2} \\
&&&&&&\vdots&=&\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_{1} &+ &a_{m2}x_{2} &+ &\dots &+ &a_{mn}x_{n} &= &b_{m} \\
\end{matrix}
$$
A solution to such a system is a sequence of $s_{1},\dots,s_{n}$ of numbers such that the assignment $x_{1}=s_{1},\dots,s_{n}$ satisfies every equation.
A linear system is called **consistent** if it has at least one solution and **inconsistent** otherwise.
