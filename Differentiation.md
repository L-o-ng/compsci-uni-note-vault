Intuitively, the **derivative** of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x=x_{0}$ is the instantaneous **rate of change** of $f$ at the point $x_{0}$, or the ==gradient==.

## First Principles
$$\array{f\text{ is differentiable at }x=x_{0}\text{ if and only if }\\\lim_{ h \to 0 }\frac{f(x_{0}+h)-f(x_{0})}{h} }$$
## Syntax
The derivative is denoted:
+ $f ^\prime(x)$
+ $\frac{df}{dx}(x)$
If $f$ is differentiable at all points in an interval $(a,b)$ then the derivative is a function: 
+ $f^\prime:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$
## Differentiability
See [[Limits of functions]] for more information.

A function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $x=a$ if $\lim_{ x \to a }\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$ exists.
$f$ **must** be continuous at $x=a$.
### Smoothness
If you can keep differentiating a function and always get a differentiable result, the function is called smooth.
