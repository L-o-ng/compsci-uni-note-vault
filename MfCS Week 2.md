1) **Which of the group axioms are satisfied by the following?**
	1) A, multiplication of even numbers - satisfies closure and associativity.
	2) B, multiplication of odd numbers - satisfies closure, associativity, and identity.
	3) C, subtraction of integers - satisfies closure, identity, and inverse.
	4) D, addition of non-negative real numbers - satisfies all axioms.
	5) E, addition on $\mathbb{Z}_5$ - satisfies all axioms.
2) Invertibility/commutativity is not an axiom of a group.

	3) $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is a field. $\mathbb{Z}_6$ is not a field.
	4) $\mathbb{Z}_n\text{ is a field if }n\in\set{2k:k\in\mathbb{Z}}.n\gt0$.
