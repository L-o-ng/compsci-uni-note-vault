ER Modelling is a model for *communication*.
It is: 
+ Non-technical;
+ Free of ambiguities.
It mainly uses UML - Unified Modelling Language.
## Components
There are: 
+ **Entities** with **Attributes**;
+ **Relationships** between entities;
+ **Constraints** on the above.
It is an example of a *top-down* approach to database design.
