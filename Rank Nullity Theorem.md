We define **nullity** as the dimension of the [[Kernel of a Linear Map|kernel]].

---

Say we are given a linear map on vector spaces $T:V \to W$:
+ If $V$ has finite dimension then: $$\operatorname{Rank}(T)+\operatorname{Nullity}(T)=\operatorname{Dim}(V)$$
+ Note that $\operatorname{dim}(W)$ is not in the formula.
