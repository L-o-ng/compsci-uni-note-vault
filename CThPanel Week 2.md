## Questions
1) What did you do immediately after graduating?
	1) KG: Spent a few years skiing etc, then worked for a geophysical company for 15 months. Started to look into software technology companies. Trained in C as a graduate within a consultancy company. Her programming experience brought her "from strength to strength".
	2) NM: Natalia spent her 3rd year as a placement in industry, so already had a foot in the door. Ended up on a graduate programme where she rotated between development teams on a bimonthly basis. Found eventually that building and integrating platforms was what she wanted to do, and moved into that sector.
	3) AP: Also did a rotation graduate scheme, and found his niche quickly in database management. After 4 years of post-office work, was hired by IBM.
2) Uni content can get quite theoretical, what was the main difference between content/skills taught at uni and skills needed in industry?
	1) AP: Andy studied history, so learned as he went along rather than having a strong theoretical foundation. The analytical skills he carried from his degree helped significantly working in teams. 
	2) NM: From a degree, the main difference is in the implementation and maintenance of code. In terms of soft skills, working with people of differing skills and opinions is a new and learned skill, as is communication. It is less about what you can program yourself and how quickly, but more the ability to share, iterate and implement them with others.
	3) KG: In the working environment, you will be competing against people with similar grades and skill. Finding a balance of confidence and ease of communication to be likeable and easy to work with makes the difference. Mediating in the event of an issue are the "people that everyone turns to". So while exams are important, it is imperative to not overlook networking and soft skill development.
3) How much do you get paid?
	1) NM: Junior engineers can expect to start on £35-45k, intermediate can expect £45-60k, and senior £60k+.
	2) AP: Andy started on a £15k wage, and ended his career at Twitter at a £140k salary. He now charges £150 per day; he believes he is very fortunate to have had the income he had.
	3) KG: Pay is sector specific - financial services pays well, as do global companies. It is not all about the base pay, but also about benefits - pension, holidays etc. Pay ends up being more and more negotiable as you progress through your career. Moving companies is unfortunately the fastest way to grow your salary, and she wishes this to change. However, moving too fast is bad. Kirstie recommends moving once every 2 years to push your salary towards the top quartile. Salary isn't indicative of wealth - some companies may also pay out large bonuses or offer a stock option.
		1) AP: Andy was payed a lot through stock dividends, and feels bad for those who got into twitter just before Musk.
			1) NM: Also consider that money isn't everything, and that a company that aligns with your personal values is potentially better than more money.
4) What would you do if your company did something that didn't align with your morals?
	1) KG: Personally, she would leave, but it is a personal decision, and if someone stays it is not a reflection of their character.
	2) NM: All companies make mistakes, and it would not be that that causes her to leave, but their response to the issue.
	3) AP: Andy had written his resignation letter before the X transition, but was left in a position where he could have stayed. He still chose to leave due to the actions of the company.
5) Andy: What was it like working at Twitter?
	1) AP: Andy worked at Twitter from 2007, and liked how it forged global connections. \[Unfinished: Worth checking replay]
6) What did you expect from a career when doing your degree that changed when you entered industry?
	1) KG: If she were to give herself some advice, she would want to take charge of her own career. You cannot expect your company to send you down all the right training courses, schemes, etc. Technology moves so fast, and you have to make time to keep up with it or you risk making yourself irrelevant. Continuously invest in yourself.
	2) NM: Natalie just picked a career she enjoyed, rather than thinking deeply about her own expectations. She is surprised about the impact she has: jumping between roles, her ideas are listened to and have a visible impact on the work of the department.
	3) AP: Andy left university in 1997, and the tech scene was completely different then. While the tech itself changes: you will likely be using something completely new in 5 years' time, the principles will be the same. It is important to keep learning - try new things and see what is useful.
7) Are you worried that AI will take your job in the future? Are you worried it will take all tech jobs?
	1) KG: She believes it will definitely take jobs, and people are not taking it seriously enough. She isn't worried about her own job, as she consults companies about their own usage of AI, but she thinks that while it is something to worry about, the jobs it will create are also significant. She believes that forward-thinking about how you will be impactful in the new world AI will bring is paramount to success. Look to how tech is going to change, and get on the bandwagon!
	2) NM: She doesn't believe AI will take her job. Someone still has to make the decisions, and tech jobs are more that just easily generated content.
	3) AP: It's complicated; it will definitely change the scene, changing roles and making some jobs redundant. \[Unfinished: Worth checking replay]
8) Does Generative AI have a future in industry?
	1) KG: In finance, it is a sackable offence to put information into a public generative system. New jobs have potential to be created, such as investing into a private solution, but when the costs are examined, it is far more convenient to use humans. AI has a long way to go in being trusted by banks - they don't believe it has "proved itself".
	2) NM: AI does have a viable role in productivity. It saves time and so cost. The actual cost of using AI software is difficult to weigh up against the gains, however. AI's usage in different sectors is very much a case-by-case basis.
	3) AP: Every step away from machine code is another layer of abstraction to make it easier for humans to interface with a computer. AI is the topmost layer of abstraction, but the power it takes to run is incredible, and he believes the environmental cost of AI is a large blind spot. Figuring out the optimisation of lower levels of abstraction is a huge issue in the scene that is overlooked.
9) What things are you the most excited/scared about?
	1) AP: Andy is excited about the ability technology gives people to communicate. 
	2) NM: Natalie is excited to see what comes out of the future of technology.
	3) KG: AI is both exciting and scary: there is endless excitement in the new things it can bring to the scene, being able to look over masses of data to solve incredibly difficult problems, and the power of the modelling it can perform. However, while AI is moving fast, governments and world politics moves very slowly, and AI is uncontrolled and largely ungoverned (not that it needs over-governing!) and its power to mislead when used by bad actors is powerful. She feels that the education system is not doing enough to warn of its impacts.
10) Any advice?
	1) KG: Believe in yourself: everyone adds something different to every situation.
	2) NM: Don't compare yourself to others: everyone brings their own skills that sets them apart. Try and take as many work opportunities as you can.
	3) AP: Be curious and try new things: often you will see things that others don't. Do good things.
